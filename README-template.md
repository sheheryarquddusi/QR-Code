## Acknowledgments

When I started working on the project I found it very hard to give it the design that is being required. You can say less of interest or research but let me tell you, you need to be very consistent in coding everything is just a search away like an open book exam. Hang on to it and you'll get this done and the satisfaction you will have after achieving is somewhat of a reward itself.
